Two arduino sketches for building a scoreboard for a game of ping pong.
<br/>

_prototype is written for use with a 2x16 LCD display
<br/>

_MATRIX is written for using 4 LED matrix panels using the HT1632C driver library
<br/>

Driver for LCD displays come default with the Arduino IDE, the HT1638 Matrix drivers (courtesy of Adafruit) however will need to be copied into your libraries folder in your 'Arduino' folder
<br/>

If you have access to a laser cutter, you can make a box for it too! the designs are made for cutting 12mm MDF/ply, make sure you adjust the width of the notches if using anything else.
